CHANGELOG = [
    "0.1.126: When an optional rgl QC view is requested, keep the generated PNG saved but do not open it automatically; when rgl is not requested, open the PNG as before.",
    "0.1.125: Updated the bundled tutorial for the dedicated 04B edge-aware neighbour workflow, canonical face-on QC plots, automatic PNG/PDF opening, non-blocking rgl inspection, and current report contents.",
    "0.1.124: Fixed QC PDF facet-value report generation, auto-opens plot PNGs, and keeps rgl inspection processes in the background so the UI remains responsive.",

    "0.1.91: Streamlined ImageJ STL extraction: multi-target runs share one Fiji session, accepted thresholds carry forward, and head export uses the preview surface.",
    "0.1.90: Replaced global spherical facet-neighbour inference with CV3D local tangent-plane neighbour detection in 05A.",
    "0.1.89: Final consolidation pass: documentation alignment, robust legacy contrast plotting, and publication-facing cleanup.",
    "0.1.88: Consolidated publication-facing geometry/optics nomenclature, 0-1 local-height contrast handling, projection-centre persistence, bilateral CP centring, circular azimuth summaries, and explicit micrometre units.",
